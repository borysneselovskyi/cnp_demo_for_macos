# cnp_demo_for_macos
This is the CNPG Demo adapted to the operator version 1.26.
Whatâ€™s new:
The backup and restore procedures have switched to the Barman plugin.
Restoring from a backup now immediately creates WAL archiving on MinIO.
New hibernation syntax has been implemented.
In-place major upgrade implemented.
Many small improvements.

The demo works on Mac laptops and the Linux version is coming soon.
